1. User Accounts:

HTML Forms: Create login and registration forms in separate HTML files (e.g., login.html, signup.php).
PHP Scripts: Develop PHP scripts (login.php, signup.php) to handle user interactions with the forms.
Login script: Validate username and password against the user table in your MySQL database using prepared statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Signup script: Sanitize user input and insert new user data into the database using prepared statements.
Session Management: Implement session management (e.g., using PHP sessions) to store user information after successful login and maintain login state across pages.
2. User Reports:

HTML Forms: Create a dedicated form in an HTML file (e.g., report.php) for users to submit trail reports. Include fields for trail name, date, report details (text area), and optional photo upload functionality.
PHP Script: Develop a PHP script (report_submit.php) to process report submissions.
Validate user input and sanitize data.
Use prepared statements to insert report data (including user ID) into a separate reports table in your database.
Handle photo uploads securely (consider file size limitations and allowed file types).
3. Report Display:

HTML & PHP: Create a page (e.g., reports.php) to display trail reports.
Use a PHP script to:
Fetch reports data from the database (ordered by date or other criteria).
Loop through the results and display relevant information (trail name, date, report excerpt) for each report.
Consider including options for pagination if there are many reports.
Use HTML to structure the report listing with appropriate headings and formatting.
4. Advocacy & Giving:

HTML: Create a dedicated page (e.g., advocacy.html) for advocacy content.
Use HTML to display informative text, images, and videos about the importance of trail maintenance and responsible use.
Donation Integration (Optional): Integrate a secure donation platform (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) using their provided APIs. This requires additional coding and may involve JavaScript or server-side processing depending on the chosen platform.
5. Database Structure:

Users Table: Store user data (username, password hash, email, etc.). Implement hashing for passwords to improve security.
Reports Table: Store trail report data (user ID, trail name, date, report details, photo path - if applicable).
Consider Additional Tables (Optional): You can add separate tables for storing trail information (difficulty, length, etc.) and campsite details (location - consider privacy implications, amenities) for future expansion.
6. Security Considerations:

Sanitize all user input to prevent SQL injection and other vulnerabilities. Use prepared statements for database interactions.
Hash user passwords securely using a one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) to avoid storing passwords in plain text.
Validate user input to prevent unexpected data types or malicious code.
7.  Testing & Deployment:

Thoroughly test login, registration, report submission, and report display functionalities.
Consider user experience and refine the design based on feedback (if possible).
Deploy your website to a web hosting platform.
Remember: This is a basic outline. You can customize and improve upon it based on your specific needs and chosen technologies (e.g., using JavaScript for form validation or client-side interactions).
