Step 1: Displaying the Database in an HTML Table

Share the PHP Page and Table Structure: Please provide the code for your current PHP page and the structure of your database table (including column names and data types).
Building the HTML Table: I can help you write code within the PHP page that fetches data from the database using a SELECT statement. This data will be used to populate an HTML table with headers and rows representing each record.


Step 2: Creating a Form for Adding and Editing Entries

Form Design: We can discuss the design of the form, including input fields for each column and buttons for submitting data (add/edit).
PHP Functionality: The PHP script will need to handle form submissions. For adding entries, it will use INSERT statements with data from the submitted form. For editing entries, it will use UPDATE statements based on an identifier (e.g., user ID).
Step 3: Implementing User Roles and Access Levels

User Type Field: We can add a user_type field to your database table to define user roles (e.g., admin, user).
Session Management: We'll need to implement a session management system (e.g., using PHP sessions) to store the logged-in user's type.
Conditional Access: The PHP script will check the user's type and grant access to functionalities (adding, editing, viewing) based on their role.
Additional Tips:

Security: Make sure to sanitize user input before inserting it into the database to prevent SQL injection attacks.
Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for database connections, form submissions, and unexpected situations.
Let's take it one step at a time. Share the initial PHP code and table structure, and we can build the first step together!
