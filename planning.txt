1.  Database Tables for Trail Reports:

You'll need a new table to store trail report data. Here's a possible structure:

trail_reports table:
id (INT PRIMARY KEY): Unique identifier for each report
user_id (INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES users(id)): Links the report to the user who created it.
trail_id (INT): (Optional) This could be a foreign key to another table for pre-defined trails if you have them.
trail_name (VARCHAR): Name of the trail (if no trail_id is used).
location (VARCHAR): Location description of the trail.
difficulty (ENUM): Predefined difficulty levels (e.g., 'Easy', 'Moderate', 'Hard').
distance (DECIMAL): Trail distance in miles or kilometers.
elevation_gain (INT): Elevation gain in feet or meters.
summary (TEXT): User's report summary about the trail.
report_text (TEXT): Detailed report content.
created_at (DATETIME): Timestamp of report creation.
updated_at (DATETIME): Timestamp of last report update (optional).
image (VARCHAR): (Optional) Stores the filename of a report image if uploaded.
2. Forms and Display Pages for Trail Reports:

Create Trail Report Form:

Design a form on a dedicated page where users can submit new reports.
Include fields for:
Trail name (or allow selecting from a predefined list if implemented)
Location
Difficulty level (dropdown menu)
Distance
Elevation gain
Summary (text area)
Report details (rich text editor or text area)
Optional image upload field
Display Trail Reports:

Design a page to display a list of trail reports.
You can display basic information like trail name, location, difficulty, and a short summary.
Consider using pagination to handle a large number of reports.
Each report entry should link to a dedicated page showing the full report details, including images (if uploaded).
Allow users to sort and filter reports based on various criteria (e.g., difficulty, location).
3. Admin Control Panel:

Create a separate section for authorized admins to manage the website.
Here are some functionalities to consider:
View all trail reports (including flagged or reported content).
Edit or delete reported trails.
Manage user accounts (view, edit, or delete)
Manage predefined trails (if implemented).
View website statistics (report views, user registrations, etc.)
4. Additional Considerations:

User Ratings and Reviews: Allow users to rate and review trails submitted by others. This can be implemented by adding another table to store user ratings and linking them to specific reports.
Search functionality: Implement a search bar to allow users to find specific trails based on keywords or filters.
Content Moderation: Consider a system for users to flag inappropriate content and allow admins to review and take action.
5. Development Approach:

Start by designing the database tables and implementing them in your database system.
Develop the forms for creating and updating trail reports. You can leverage HTML, CSS, and Javascript for these functionalities.
Design the display pages for listing and viewing individual reports.
Finally, implement the admin control panel with functionalities mentioned earlier.
Remember:

Break down the development process into smaller tasks.
Test and refine each component as you build it.
Consider using existing libraries or frameworks for functionalities like rich text editors or image uploads.
This plan provides a roadmap for developing the core features of your trail report sharing website. As you progress, you can explore additional features and functionalities based on user needs and feedback.
